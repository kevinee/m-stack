CDC/ACM virtual COM port
------------------------

The CDC class enables USB-serial (e.g. RS232) converters to be automatically
assigned to a COM/tty port on the host, without any user interaction. This
is useful for legacy equipment and host software which uses such ports but
for new designs there are better ways to communicate with a PIC MCU.
See the Vendor_WinUSB_WCID example.
